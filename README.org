** What is SampleHive?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: what-is-samplehive
:END:

This dirty fork of sample hive can only one thing - opening directories with sound files in it and than quickly zapping through the files and previewing it.
This software can no tagging or hive functionality like the original software but i only needed that functionality and nothing else and I'm a bit
to lazy to implement it the right way.
So basicly if you open a directory it imports the soundfiles/samples into the database and after opening the next directory the samples are
deleted and the new ones are importet. 
So it's good for organizing the samples directory based.

** Dependencies
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: dependencies
:END:
On Arch based distributions,

#+begin_example
sudo pacman -S wxgtk3 wxsvg sqlite taglib yaml-cpp libsndfile spdlog
#+end_example

On Debian, Ubuntu and distributions based the on two,

#+begin_example
sudo apt install libwxbase3.0-dev libwxgtk-media3.0-gtk3-dev libwxgtk3.0-gtk3-dev wx3.0-headers libsqlite3-dev libyaml-cpp-dev libtagc0-dev libtag1-dev libtagc0 libexif-dev libpango1.0-dev libsndfile1-dev libspdlog-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev libgstreamer-plugins-bad1.0-dev
#+end_example

You might also need to install =git=, =cmake=, =meson= and =g++= as well, if you don't already have them installed in order to build SampleHive.

*NOTE:* On Debian and Debian based distributions you also have to install =libwxgtk-media3.0-dev=

** How to build SampleHive?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: how-to-build-samplehive
:END:
Download the source code from this repository or use a git clone:

#+begin_example
git clone https://gitlab.com/samplehive/sample-hive
cd sample-hive
meson build -Dprefix=/tmp/SampleHive
ninja -C build install
#+end_example

This will install SampleHive under =/tmp/SampleHive=.

The configuration file will be placed under =~/.config/SampleHive/config.yaml= and the database file will be placed under =~/.local/share/SampleHive/sample.hive=

/NOTE:/ If you don't provide the =-Dprefix=/tmp/SampleHive= by default it will be installed under =/usr/local=. You can set the prefix to anything you want.

** How to run SampleHive?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: how-to-run-samplehive
:END:
To run SampleHive:

If you provided a prefix, you can go the prefix directory then go to the =bin= directory and run the SampleHive binary, for example, assuming the prefix was set to =/tmp/SampleHive=

#+begin_example
cd /tmp/SampleHive/bin
./SampleHive
#+end_example

If you didn't provide a prefix, you can find SampleHive in your menu system or run launcher and run SampleHive as you would run any other program on you system.

** Are there any keybindings for SampleHive?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: are-there-any-keybindings-for-samplehive
:END:
// TODO

** Can I configure SampleHive?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: can-i-configure-samplehive
:END:
SampleHive comes with a =config.yaml= file, that is placed under =~/.config/SampleHive/config.yaml=, that you can edit to change some settings for it.

** How do I contribute to the SampleHive?
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: how-do-i-contribute-to-samplehive
